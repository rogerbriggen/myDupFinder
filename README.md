# myDupFinder
Find duplicates of files (or checks if the backup still is ok...)

State: in develompent... unusable right now

Roadmap:
- Scan Files and generate hash information
- Find dups in one database
- Find dups in different databases
- Visually show the dups and manually change the state
- Delete / Move the dups
- Refresh a database
- Check a database with the original files (bit rot, changes of files)
